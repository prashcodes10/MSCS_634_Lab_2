# MSCS 634 - Lab 2
## K-Nearest Neighbors and Radius Neighbors Classification

### Purpose
This lab explores the performance of KNN and Radius Neighbors classifiers using the Wine dataset from sklearn. The goal is to analyze how different parameter values affect classification accuracy.

### Key Insights
- KNN performance varies with k.
- Moderate k values generally provide better balance between bias and variance.
- RNN performance depends heavily on the radius value.
- KNN showed more consistent accuracy compared to RNN in this experiment.

### Challenges
- Selecting appropriate radius values.
- Handling cases where no neighbors were found in RNN.
